            <dl>
              <dt>ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM</dt>
                <dd>A style of painting that emerged during the 1940s and ’50s, pioneered by artists based mainly in New York. The term covers the dynamism of ‘action painting’ as typified by Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the calm of ‘color field’ works by Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman.</dd>

              <dt>ARTE POVERA</dt>
                <dd>A term coined by Italian art critic and curator Germano Celant in 1967. Literally meaning ‘poor art,’ the artists associated with this group explored the unrestrained use of media other than painting.</dd>

              <dt>AVANT-GARDE</dt>
                <dd>The French term for ‘advance guard’ or ‘vanguard,’ meaning to be ‘at the forefront.’ Avant-garde art refers to work that pushes conventional boundaries of mainstream social values.</dd>

              <dt>BAUHAUS</dt>
                <dd>Operating from 1919 to 1933, a German school of art and crafts founded by Walter Gropius. Its aesthetic became highly influential in the fields of architecture and furniture design in Western Europe, Israel and the United States.</dd>
      
              <dt>BUBBLE ECONOMY</dt>
                <dd>Japan’s bubble economy of the 1980s was characterized by rampant speculation and banks issuing risky loans, which drove Japanese equity and real-estate markets to astronomical price levels. The bubble burst at the turn of the decade, leading to severe recession during the 1990s.</dd>

              <dt>BUTOH</dt>
                <dd>Also known as <em>Ankoku Butoh</em> (Dance of Complete Darkness), butoh is a style of dance pioneered by Tatsumi Hijikata in the late 1950s as an exploration of man’s primal energy and a criticism of society and culture. Usually characterized by dancers performing almost nude and wearing white body make-up, butoh can range from jerky, visceral bodily expression to almost imperceptibly subtle movement.</dd>

              <dt id="chimpom">CHIM↑POM</dt>
                <dd>Formed in Tokyo in 2005, this collective is made up of six artists: Ellie, Ryuta Ushiro, Yasutaka Hayashi, Masataka Okada, Toshinori Mizuno, and Motomu Inaoka, They have achieved notoriety for their anarchic, sometimes politically engaged performative artworks. In November 2008 they sparked a media outcry in Hiroshima after writing the word <em>PIKA</em> [meaning 'flash' and a clear reference to atomic explosions] in the sky over Hiroshima. This resulted in the cancelation of their scheduled exhibition at Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art. In April 2011 they protested the government’s handling of the Fukushima nuclear crisis by modifying Taro Okamoto’s <em>The Myth of Tomorrow</em> (1967). Installed in Shibuya Station, this massive multi-panel painting depicting people in a post-apocalyptic landscape but is missing two small panels. Chim↑Pom inserted their own painting of mushroom clouds emanating from destroyed reactors into one of the empty slots in Okamoto’s piece.</dd>
      
              <dt>CONCEPTUAL ART</dt>
                <dd>A broad range of artworks produced during the 1960s in which the ideas behind the work are primary in conveying their message to the viewer, in rejection of the conventional art object. Key conceptual artists include Joseph Beuys, Yves Klein, On Kawara and Yoko Ono.</dd>

              <dt>DADA</dt>
                <dd>Emerging simultaneously in Europe and the US during World War I, the Dada artists had a cynical attitude towards bourgeois social values and ridiculed culture and traditional forms, believing them to be the root causes of the war. Artists associated with the movement include Marcel Duchamp, Francis Picabia and Man Ray.</dd>

              <dt id="dumbtype">DUMB TYPE</dt>
                <dd>Formed in Kyoto in 1984, this artist collective's work spanned visual arts, dance, theater, architecture, music, and computer programming. Their work has a social and political activist character, confronting themes such as AIDS, civilization, nationality, identity, communication. Core members of the group are Teiji Furuhashi, Toru Koyamada, Yukihiro Hozumi, Shiro Takatani, Takayuki Fujimoto, and Hiromasa Tomari. Founding member Teiji Furuhashi died of AIDS in 1995, age 35.</dd>

                <dd>See <span class="sc">JIKKEN KOBO</span>.</dd>

              <dt>FLUXUS</dt>
                <dd>The Latin word for “to flow.” Founder George Maciunias used it to describe a loose network of artists, poets, composers and designers who were engaged in experimental forms of art, music, poetry and performance art in New York and West Germany during the 1960s and ’70s. Key figures include John Cage, Yoko Ono and Shigeko Kubota.</dd>

              <dt id="gutai">GUTAI ART ASSOCIATION</dt>
                <dd>Active from 1954 to 1972, the Gutai Art Association (<em>Gutai Bijutsu Kyokai</em>) was a group of artists based in the OsakaKobe region. Led by Jiro Yoshihara, their work was as diverse as it was unusual: Kazuo Shiraga wrestling with mud, Saburo Murakami running through large layers of paper, and Atsuko Tanaka’s dress constructed out of fluorescent tubes are some of the group’s most well-known works. In 2013, a major survey exhibition, "Gutai: Splendid Playground," was held at the Guggenheim Museum in New York.</dd>
      
              <dt>HAPPENINGS</dt>
                <dd>A term initially coined by American artist Allan Kaprow in 1959 to describe actions and theatrical events performed by artists with audience participation. Like the <span class="sc">PERFORMANCE ART</span> that developed after it (focusing less on theatricality and more on artists’ actions), it is usually documented through photography and video.</dd>

              <dt id="hiredcenter">HI RED CENTER</dt>
                <dd>Formed in 1963 and active until 1964, this Tokyo-based avant-garde group was made up of Jiro Takamatsu, Gempei Akasegawa, and Natsuyuki Nakanishi. The group's name derives from the first character in each of the artists' last names (Taka, Aka, Naka), which translate as High, Red, Center. The artists staged spontaneous, Neo-Dadaist public installations and performances that questioned social homogeneity and consumerism, such as their 'drops,' in which they would drop various consumer goods from the roofs of buildings, then put them in a locker somewhere and give someone the key.</dd>

              <dt>IMPRESSIONISM</dt>
                <dd>A painting movement begun in the 1860s, made up of artists such as Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Auguste Renoir who paid close attention to subtle changes in light and went against convention by painting with small, opaque daubs of paint rather than thin, translucent layers.</dd>
      
              <dt>INFORMEL</dt>
                <dd>‘Art Informel’ was a term used by French art critic and dealer Michel Tapié to describe a wide variety of abstract painting spanning several countries during the 1940s and ’50s and emphasizing the use of ‘material’ and ‘gesture.’</dd>

              <dt id=jikkenkobo>JIKKEN KOBO (EXPERIMENTAL WORKSHOP)</dt>
                <dd>Founded in Tokyo in 1951, this group of 14 artists, musicians, choreographers, set designers and poets was active until circa 1957. Inspired by John Cage's compositions, Martha Graham’s choreography, and the sculpture of Alexander Calder and Isamu Noguchi, Jikken Kobo staged interdisciplinary ballets, recitals, and 'sensory' experiences of art.</dd>

              <dt id="kyushuha">KYUSHU-HA</dt>
                <dd>Kyushu-ha (known as Group Kyushu in English) was active in Fukuoka and Tokyo from 1957 until 1962. Its members fluctuated in number but included approximately 25 in total—among them notable figures such as Yasuyuki Ishibashi, Osamu Ochi, Mokuma Kikuhata, Takami Sakurai, Mitsuko Tabe, Kenichiro Terada, and Mamoru Matano. With few of the artists formally trained in art and all hailing from Kyushu, the group adopted an Anti-Art strategy to oppose the rigid, master-disciple structure of Tokyo-centric art institutions. Influenced by <span class="sc">INFORMEL</span>, Kyushu-ha's works included assemblages of ripped and burned canvasses, stapled cardboard, works covered in tar, and some pieces covered in urine and excrement. They were the first group to be forbidden from exhibiting at the Yomiuri Independent exhibition.</dd>

              <dt>LAND ART</dt>
                <dd>Projects, often large in scale, undertaken by several US artists since the late 1960s. Most prominent was Robert Smithson’s <em>Spiral Jetty</em> (1970), a fifteen-hundred-foot-long coil of rock, earth and algae protruding into the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Particularly large works such as this are also known as ‘Earth Works.’ By making works outside of the gallery, which were often eroded by natural phenomena, the Land Artists attempted to counter the perception of art as an acquirable commodity.</dd>
      
              <dt>MEDIA ART</dt>
                <dd>New-media art incorporates the use of new technologies, including the Internet, computer graphics and animation.</dd>

              <dt>MINIMALISM</dt>
                <dd>Works of art, music and design that are stripped down to their bare essentials. Developed in the United States in the 1960s, minimalist artworks are typically simple geometric two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes and are considered in part a reaction against <span class="sc">ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM</span>. Donald Judd, Carl Andre and Robert Morris are some of the movement’s most well-known artists.</dd>
      
              <dt>MODERN ART</dt>
                <dd>Modern art began with Gustave Courbet and Pablo Picasso in the early 20th century and had the connotation of ‘contemporary art’ at the time. After World War II, there emerged a need to distinguish ‘modern art’ from ‘contemporary art’ for aesthetic as well as institutional reasons. Definitions of contemporary art can vary from post-1945, to post-1960, sometimes even post-1980.</dd>

              <dt>MODERNISM</dt>
                <dd>An approach to art, architecture and design that rejects past art forms in favor of constant innovation. The term has been applied to the succession of art movements from the mid-19th century to the end of the 1960s.</dd>
      
              <dt id="monoha">MONO-HA</dt>
                <dd>Literally meaning ‘School of Things,’ this group of artists was active from the late 1960s to the early 1970s. They sought to challenge pre-existing perceptions of material and space by juxtaposing a wide range of natural and manmade materials — left as far as possible in an unaltered state — to allow materiality to speak for itself, almost entirely free of artistic intervention. In 2012, a major survey exhibition, "Requiem for the Sun: The Art of Mono-ha," was held at <span class="sc">BLUM & POE</span> in Los Angeles.</dd>

              <dt id="ndo">NEO-DADAISM ORGANIZERS</dt>
                <dd>Developing Anti-Art activities inspired by the <span class="sc">DADA</span> in Western Europe, this group of artists showed at the Yomiuri Independent exhibitions of the late 1950s. The group formed, dissolved, and reformed several times, but the core that formed in March 1960 included Genpei Akasegawa, Shusaku Arakawa, Sho Kazakura, Ushio Shinohara, Soroku Toyoshima, and Masunobu Yoshimura. Later Shintaro Tanaka and Shin Kinoshita joined. Two other Anti-Art practitioners, Tetsumi Kudo and Tomio Miki, were associated with the group but never joined.</dd>
      
              <dt>NHK</dt>
                <dd>Nippon Hoso Kyokai, the Japan Broadcasting Corp., Japan’s public television and radio broadcasting corporation founded in 1926.</dd>

              <dt>NIHONGA</dt>
                <dd>Literally ‘Japanese painting,’ it is in effect ‘Japanese-style painting’ developed after the Meiji Restoration in 1868 to counteract the emergence of Western-style <span class="sc">YOGA</span>. It follows conventions and techniques of traditional Japanese painting, using mineral pigments or ink bonded with animal-hide glue on Japanese <em>washi</em> paper or silk.</dd>

              <dt>PERFORMANCE ART</dt>
                <dd>Originating from <span class="sc">HAPPENINGS</span>, the use of the body by an individual artist or group of artists to create an artwork as an action at a particular time at a particular place. During the 1960s, key performance artists included Vito Acconci, Joseph Beuys and Yoko Ono.</dd>
      
              <dt>POP ART</dt>
                <dd>Made famous by artists such as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Peter Blake, Pop art was a 1950s and ’60s US and British movement that took imagery from popular and commercial culture — be it celebrity icons, action hero comics or multicolored targets. Their works were a reaction against <span class="sc">ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM</span> and <span class="sc">MODERNISM</span> and heralded the onset of <span class="sc">POSTMODERNISM</span>.</dd>

              <dt>POSTMODERNISM</dt>
                <dd>An intellectual climate in which it was felt that new, original <span class="sc">AVANT-GARDE</span> work could no longer be produced. Postmodernism was a reaction against <span class="sc">MODERNISM</span> and applies to art, literature, philosophy, architecture and criticism. It rejects the notion that reality can be subjected to objective, scientific categorization, positing instead that it is constructed by human understanding and interpretation.</dd>
      
             <dt>PRIMARY MARKET</dt>
                <dd>The market that handles the first sale of an artwork, composed mainly of commercial galleries that represent artists’ interests.</dd>

                <dd>A contraction of 'Sejima and Nishizawa Associates,' <span class="sc">SANAA</span> is an architectural firm founded in 1995 by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa. Among their most famous buildings are the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York; the Christian Dior flagship store in Omotesando, Tokyo; and the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa. In 2010, Sejima and Nishizawa were awarded the Pritzker Prize, and Sejima was the first woman to direct the Venice Architecture Biennale.</dd>

             <dt>SECONDARY MARKET</dt>
                <dd>The market for the reselling of artworks after their initial sale, including auction houses.</dd>
                
              <dt id="showa40">SHOWA 40 NEN KAI (GROUP 1965)</dt>
                <dd>Showa 40 is the year 1965 in the Japanese calendar. Showa 40 nen kai (pronounced <em>showa yonju nenkai</em>) is a loose collective of artists, formed in 1994, who happen to share 1965 as their year of birth. Original members included Makoto Aida, Chie Kaihatsu, Parco Kinoshita, Hiroyuki Matsukage, Oscar Oiwa, Tsuyoshi Ozawa, and Yutaka Sone. Respectively, the artists use widely varying media and approaches, but as a group their work during the 1990s reflected their frustration by the limitations of the Japanese scene—especially the dominance of the rental gallery system—to which they responded with neo-Dadaist absurdism, including guerilla interventions in public space. Among their most famous works is Tsuyoshi Ozawa's <em>Nasubi Galleries</em>, small milk boxes that acted as miniature, portable white-cube exhibition spaces in which other artists in the group showed their work.</dd>
                
             <dt>STABLE</dt>
                <dd>A term that gallery owners use to refer to the artists they represent.</dd>
      
             <dt>WHITE CUBE</dt>
                <dd>The great majority of exhibition spaces in galleries and museums are white-walled, boxlike spaces, designed to be as neutral a display environment as possible.</dd>
      
             <dt>YOGA</dt>
                <dd>Literally meaning ‘Western painting’, <em>yoga</em> was an art form that made use of the Western oil painting techniques that poured into Japan following the 1868 Meiji Restoration. Western-style painting that predates the Meiji Restoration is known as <em>yofuga</em>. <em>Yoga</em> continues today, largely emulating the work of the <span class="sc">IMPRESSIONISTS</span>.</dd>
      
             <dt>YOUNG BRITISH ARTISTS (YBAS)</dt>
                <dd>A group of artists recognized since the late 1980s for their diverse range of multimedia works. Iconic works such as Damien Hirst’s shark in a tank of formaldehyde, Tracy Emin’s dirty bed and surrounding detritus, and Chris Ofili’s images of the Virgin Mary incorporating elephant dung were both highly controversial and commercially successful.</dd>
